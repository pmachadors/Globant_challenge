# Description
Data Engineer challenge, consisting in steps:

1. Move historic data from files in CSV format to the new database.
2. Create a Rest API service to receive new data. This service must have:
2.1. Each new transaction must fit the data dictionary rules.
2.2. Be able to insert batch transactions (1 up to 1000 rows) with one request.
2.3. Receive the data for each table in the same service.
2.4. Keep in mind the data rules for each table.
3. Create a feature to backup for each table and save it in the file system in AVRO format.
4. Create a feature to restore a certain table with its backup.

The csv files are stored in AWS S3 bucket and the database choosed was AWS RDS MySql. I used Insomnia software to test my REST API.

# Requirements
docker docker-compose aws account

# Functionalities
1. Historical data import was made by python script import_historical_data.py. The script will create the database and tables and also insert data from csv jobs, departments and hired_employees stored in S3 AWS.
 Usage:
 Export your RDS MySql connection variables like that:
 
 export mysql_user=your_user
 export db_name=your_db
 export end_point=your_end_point
 export mysql_new_pwd=your_password
 
 python3 import_historical_data.py
